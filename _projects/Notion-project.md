## Notion for Support teams! 

### The what
I put together this project as part of an interview assignment. For the assignment I created a **project plan** and **work samples** that consisted of a:

 - Course outline
 - Tutorial video that would be included in the course
 - Short knowledge check

> Take a look over the [entire plan](https://katieslearnings.com/assets/Notion-for-Support-Teams.pdf).

And check out the video I created for the assignment, below:

### The how
For this fictional course development project, the detailed plan below includes essential phases designed to ensure a thorough and efficient development process. Initial stages focused on comprehensive needs assessment and aligning objectives with user requirements. The project plan outlined structured content creation, including scripting and developing engaging multimedia assets such as tutorial videos and interactive modules. To maintain quality, an iterative review cycle was incorporated, followed by pilot testing with feedback loops and determining the KPIs to evaluate the success of the course.

### The why
It's so important that new users have exceptional learning experiences when onboarding to a new software platform. Self-paced online learning courses play a significant role in this experience, and this course project plan ensures users (in this case, support reps):

 - Have all the necessary information they need to do their jobs effectively
 - Can intuitively navigate the learning experience
 - Get active learning experiences
