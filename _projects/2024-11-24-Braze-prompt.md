# Personalize customer experience with variables and API integrations

## Background

Ada is a generative AI chatbot platform that helps businesses deliver personalized customer experiences at scale. It integrates with other tools and platforms to expand its capabilities and improve customer experience. For example, an e-commerce site using Ada might connect it to their Shopify instance, allowing customers to interact with the bot to check order statuses or track shipping updates. To set up these integrations, users need to understand variables and APIs and configure them within Ada.

My team had product data that showed that customers who integrate with other platforms are significantly more likely to renew their subscriptions. Because of this, we prioritized the development of a comprehensive personalization and integration learning path. Our legacy course was outdated and frequently criticized for being confusing and unhelpful. To address this, we set out to create an accessible and guided learning journey that would equip customers with the skills and confidence to implement API integrations, ultimately driving product adoption and customer retention.

## Get started with personalization

To successfully integrate other platforms with Ada and understand how APIs work, users first need a solid grasp of concepts like variables.

The following videos are taken from the course that introduces users to variables, the building blocks for creating personalized customer experiences. While the videos are a key component of the course, they are complemented by text-based content, images, diagrams, hands-on practice activities, and quizzes. 

Unfortunately, I no longer have access to the actual courses themselves as Ada Academy is only available to their customers. I’m happy to discuss the course design and structure further to give you a more well-rounded idea of the learning experience we built.

## Integrate with APIs
As users progress through the learning path, they get introduced to API concepts that cater to diverse technical skill levels. The content covered the very basics of APIs for less technical audiences, ensuring accessibility and confidence building, while providing flexibility for advanced users to skip beginner content and dive straight into detailed implementation guidance. 

This approach acknowledged that most Ada users came from less technically advanced backgrounds and ensured they could successfully engage with and configure integrations.
