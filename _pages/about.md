## Hi! I'm Katie.

I'm a learning designer who loves learning about learning (surprise!), providing engaging courses for life-long learners, developing relationships that allow the learning design process to come to life, and fostering the professional development of my peers. 

I like to have fun but I'm serious when it comes to developing relevant and contextual learning content that upskills software users and improves their day-to-day. I believe fully in the power of learning by doing and creating beautiful and engaging learning experiences.
